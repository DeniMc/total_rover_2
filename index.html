            2022 is the year of the Rover. A wild rollercoaster ride on a train Bound for Glory. SFC Friedrichshain Rovers. Going Strong since 2011 in the Friedrichshain Badlands. A rag tag crew of Rockers, Ballers, Poets, Vikings, Pirates, Scholars and Gentlemen drawn together from all over the world here in Berlin capital of  and united by a love of all things Kickball. The belief that no matter your size, your colour, your age, your gender, your background, that football is for everyone. And everyone is Welcome. Rovers play to win. That is for sure. But above all they play for each other. For the team. For the spirit. For the distraction. For the craic. Play like you don't give a fuck and the prizes will follow.

            Proud to be a Rover

            Proud to love football.
            
            Football is the beautiful game.
            
            Beautiful because anyone with a ball and a wall can play. But the real fun is in playing together. 
            
            Beautiful because anyone, anywhere can play irrespective of race, wealth, age, disability, gender , sexual orientation or identity.
            
            Proud to believe that football should be open, accessible and welcoming to everyone.
            
            Proud as a Rover to believe that everyone should not only be accepted but celebrated as unique and embraced for who they are and the unique contributions they can make.
            
            No 2 people are the same. And for that we are thankful. Diversity is the spice of life. 
            
            No discrimination. Ever. Not in football. Not In life. 
            
            Proud to embrace everyone for who they are and endeavour to encourage and stand up tall for anyone who needs some support. 
            
            
            
            Love Rovers. Love football. Love life. Love everyone.

           Total Roverism. Playing kickball the way it was intended. With joy. with passion, with flair and with love. Part Cruyffism. Part fatalism. For our heroes. Maradonna, Georgie Best. paul McGrath. Baggio. Julian Dicks. No diving. No whining. The realisation that we're on a roller-coaster not quite of our control. Take the hits. Roll with the punches. You won't always score. You won't always claim the 3 points,but if you try your little heart out you'll succeed more often than not.. Always always pick yourself up when you've been knocked down. Learn a valuable lesson in even in defeat and never ever ever ever....ever give up, then you will never lose no matter which way the ball decides to roll. The team is king. Rovers Ã¼ber alles. Kickball 4-life.
